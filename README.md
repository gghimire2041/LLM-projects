## 0 Text Summarization
### Introduction
Text summarization using large language models involves leveraging the capabilities of these models, like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models or similar architectures, to condense a piece of text into a shorter version while retaining its essential information. Here's a general approach:

#### a. Extractive Summarization:
Large language models can perform extractive summarization, where they identify and extract the most important sentences or phrases from the original text to form the summary. This method doesn't generate new sentences but selects and rearranges existing ones.

```python
from openai import OpenAIAPI

text = "Your long piece of text goes here..."

# Using GPT-3 to summarize the text
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your API key
openai = OpenAIAPI(api_key)
summary = openai.summarize(text, max_tokens=150)

print("Summary:", summary)

```

#### b. Abstractive Summarization:
Abstractive summarization involves creating a summary that might contain rephrased sentences or new sentences synthesized by the model based on the context of the original text.

```python
from openai import OpenAIAPI

text = "Your long piece of text goes here..."

# Using GPT-3 to generate an abstractive summary
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your API key
openai = OpenAIAPI(api_key)
response = openai.create_completion(
    prompt=f"Summarize the following text:\n{text}",
    max_tokens=100,
    temperature=0.3,
    top_p=1.0,
    frequency_penalty=0.0,
    presence_penalty=0.0,
    stop=["\n"]
)

summary = response.choices[0].text.strip()

print("Summary:", summary)
```
#### Notes
Fine-tuning: Some models may require fine-tuning on summarization-specific datasets to improve their performance on this task.
Length Control: Parameters like max_tokens control the length of the summary generated by limiting the number of tokens.
Model Selection: Different models might perform differently for text summarization tasks based on their architectures and training objectives.
