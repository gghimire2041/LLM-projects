# Retrieval-Augmented Generation Repository

This repository contains resources, code, and documentation related to retrieval-augmented generation in natural language processing.

## Overview

Retrieval-augmented generation combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the quality of natural language generation. This technique leverages pre-existing knowledge from retrieval systems to augment the output of generative models, resulting in more coherent and contextually relevant text generation.

## Contents

- **Code**: Contains implementations, scripts, or notebooks showcasing retrieval-augmented generation techniques.
- **Resources**: Additional resources such as pre-trained models, datasets, or supplementary materials.
- **Documentation**: Guides, explanations, and tutorials on how to use the code and reproduce results.
- **Research Papers**: References to relevant research papers and articles in the field.
